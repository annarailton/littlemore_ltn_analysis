    "# Littlemore Parish Council LTN questionnaire analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was collected in October 2021 via distributing paper copies of this questionnaire (TODO: link to questionnaire). Questionnaires were only distributed to those who were in when we knocked on the door then we went round a second time to pick them up. From experience, this gets significantly better engagement than simply dropping the questionnaire through the door with no interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to not use an online option as \n",
    "- easy to brigade (i.e. spam with multiple responses)\n",
    "- more difficult to get good geographic coverage throughout Littlemore\n",
    "- not as accessible for older people\n",
    "- expected lower engagement, with only the most engaged already taking part\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flats were difficult to do so we have poor coverage here\n",
    "- We did not have time nor the man power to visit multiple times so there will be a bias to those who are in early evening (5-7pm ish)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anonymisation (TODO)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it impossible (as far as possible) to not identify individuals from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Only identifiable data is street name (collected no demographic data like age) so we bundle streets together geographically if there are less than [TODO] responses for a single street. This has been done before this notebook - this notebook works on the anonymised data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes on specific questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw numbers difficult to use without knowing number of people in household. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsure if people are filling this in as intented (i.e. missing the \"driving\" aspect). Should've been more carefully worded. Needed a \"don't drive\" box. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of people missed this question; placement right at the top of the page made it less obvious?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7 and 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Some normalisation happened here when transcribing *e.g.*\n",
    "- \"It takes a long time to get to my destination\" -> \"Longer journeys\"\n",
    "- Mapped a lot of related things to \"traffic displacement\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This was to:\n",
    "- Make it easier and quicker to input, without losing data\n",
    "- Make it easier to analyse later\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 10\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of people used this for expanding on Question 8 (problem with LTN) rather than thinking of other solutions. Negatives of the LTN were moved to Question 8 responses. Similar to the free-text fields of Questions 7 and 8, some paraphrasing took place. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Bad data\n",
    "\n",
    "Only spotted a couple of obvious duplicates (same hand writing, same pen, very similar content, same road). These were removed from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Missed opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "Should've asked:\n",
    "- number of people in household\n",
    "- number of cars in household\n",
    "- age data\n"
