Physical and mental health impacts.,Yes,"• I've been told that Cowley Rd LM (CRL) was shut 'to stop traffic coming to Cowley from the A4074 via littlemore'. This may have helped Cowley, but since shutting CRL makes OxRoad more vulnerable to A4074/Kassam/Grenoble Road traffic, the council ought to address the problem nearer the source especially since the Science Park is growing, the new trunk road across the Thames will increase traffic on the A4074, and there are to be thousands of new homes on Grenoble Road. 

• The LTN authorities have said that LM could campaign for LTNs: LPC should ask for the consultation on this lot to be extended a year while this is explored. Cowley only got its LTNs first because there was coincidently a proposal (from a bike group) in place when Govt Funds became available. 

• LPC and Sandford on Thames PC should work together to campaign to address the way Sandford Road and Oxford Road are used as a rat run. 

• The 7.5T 'except for access' limit on Oxford Road needs to be reviewed. Oxford Road is now the main access road to the whole of LM and parts of Sandford: it is being treated by the authorities as if it is an A Road and not an unclassified residential road: it is a rat run (as above). The sign is effectively meaningless: if Oxford Road is fundamentally unsuitable to these vehicles the sign ought to say so, the restriction should be policed and the unfair and unreasonable pressure on Oxford Road ought to be taken seriously. 

• Until there are sensible plans to address the problem Oxford Road faces, there should be a moratorium on further development that will impact Littlemore: this would include the Science Village, whose purpose is to allow further development of the Science Park (le not to house existing workers 

• The Science Park and the Kassam Complex which are both in LM should be required to put more into supporting our infrastructure 

• SatNav companies could be required to direct traffic from the Kassam complex and the Science Park away from Sandford Road and Oxford Road. 

• 1 recognise that the council wants to create lots of cul de sacs (except where it suits them, as in Oxford Road) but the pressure in Oxford Road could be relieved by opening up some roads: Champion Way could be opened in one direction at least on to Sandy Lane West. There are others. 

• Littlemore Roundabout needs redesigning: there should be a phase of the lights to allow traffic out of Oxford Road, and protected space on the roundabout for cars whose drivers wish to leave Ox Road. 

• If CRL is to remain shut then the filter should allow taxis and emergency vehicles through: the filter shou so as to allow L residents who live nearer Cowley than Heyford Hill to use their local shopping centre: CO-OP lorries could then approach Bartholomew Rd without going through LM village, and the filter in Bartholomew Road might then be removed. 

• The whole of Oxford (including LM) should be a LEZ: like London, with a congestion charge, cameras and enforcement. "

I feel conflicted about LTNs, if they actually reduce the traffic then maybe they are good. If not they concentrate pollution on some roads whilst removing it from others which is unfair, plus driving further causes more pollution. I get blocking rat runs but Littlemore and Bartholomew Roads are not rat runs. They are the way to get to Cowley Centre and BBL Leisure Centre from Littlemore. My preference has always been to cycle/walk locally where time/weather/load permits. It is annoying not to be able to drive down these roads and the back way to Cowley Road (city centre) due to the LTNs. I also feel LTNs penalise people who can't walk or cycle."

Give more pollution. Make more traffic build up.",No,"I have not filled out the online  LTN consultation, because like many people can not use a computer etc.
Just put back the use of roads as before. When you sit in jammed up traffic in cowley area pouring out pollution due to the free movement of traffic has been stopped. Livingin cowley for 74 years I have never heard of anybody asking for roads to be shut. This operation to shut roads appear to me and large amount of other people a case of do what I say. No proper voting or consultation. E.W Armstrong"

Look up the word ROAD in the dictionary. it says : "" Leading from one place to another that vehicles use!! NOT: Lets block all roads making vehicles use other roads and cause major pollution, road rage and longer journeys!
PLUS the poor refuge drivers, taxis,999's and local shops losing business, especially the coop. Take them down!!
Don't try and fix something that isn't broke. Its a waste of our council tax money. Use it to put residential parking down Sandy lane west + Spring Lane when football is on!!!"
